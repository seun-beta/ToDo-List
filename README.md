# ToDo List WebApp

## I built this web app using the Bottle Python WSGI MicroFramework. ##   

I decided to use Bottle because of its ease of learning compared to CherryPy and web2py.  
  
I decided to build a ToDo List web app using bottle to apply my knowledge of SQL as Bottle doesn't abstract SQL like Django & Flask.

1. The database used was SQLite.  
2. The frontend was built using Bottle's in-built template (.tpl files).  
3. The logic was built using Python.

 You can read more about Bottle using its official [Documentation](https://bottlepy.org/docs/0.12/).

> You can only truly learn by applying what you have learnt.
